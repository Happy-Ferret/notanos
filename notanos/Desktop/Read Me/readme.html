<h2>What? Why?</h2>

<p>This is a experimental concept. &nbsp; I don&#39;t think I can fully articulate the&nbsp;ideas and goals that went into this. &nbsp;For the most part it is an expreiment to see how far this particular path can go and where it might lead.</p>

<p>At this early stage of development all the system provides is a fairly simple Windowed Environment with a few applications. &nbsp;Almost everything is run in JavaScript. &nbsp;The exception is&nbsp;Termish which is a terminal emulator communicating via WebSockets to a bash shell.</p>

<p><span >One of the ideas that has been motivating this development is that I like the idea of running a &quot;cloud in my pocket&quot; &nbsp;I have a version of Notanos running on a 7-inch tablet that sits in my jacket pocket and I can access the environment from web browsers of desktop machines wherever I happen to be. &nbsp;I require neither internet access for this, nor do I need to trust an online provider with my data (although I could easily sync the file system to a cloud service if I wished to protect myself from the loss of my tablet.</span></p>

<p>A particular use-case that I thought would utilize this model well would be the scenario where you take photographs with your mobile device and then open an image editing package on a nearby desktop machine to do some adjustments without ever needing to move the images off your phone or&nbsp;tablet.</p>

<p>Another possibility is providing an interface where application executables run on the server side and the interface runs on the browser side. &nbsp;This falls somewhere between a model-view-controller WebApp&nbsp;and an X11&nbsp;style application. &nbsp;B<span >y opening up a </span>WebSocket<span > channel from the browser back to a connection </span>multiplexer<span >&nbsp;server side programs could request services from the browser. &nbsp;This would be roughly analogous to </span>X11<span > where instead of a DISPLAY environment variable indicating where to open an </span>X11<span > connection you have a </span>NOTANOS_DISPLAY<span > environment variable that indicates which browser view to use.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>There is absolutely no security layer on&nbsp;<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Notanos</span>&nbsp;at this time. &nbsp;My focus has been on getting things to work. &nbsp;There should be a&nbsp;layer that negotiates a login and provides&nbsp;an authorization token that is required for all server operations. &nbsp;That layer does not yet exist.</p>

<p>There is so much that could be done and so much to do, &nbsp;I shall be chipping away at this for some time to come and I&#39;ll be putting the work on Github. &nbsp; I am aiming to get a sufficient API for Web-apps to enable third party programs. There is currently a Open Dialog but no Save as Dialog yet :-/.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Notanos sits in a directory that is served by a Static Server (using&nbsp;WebDav to support FINDPROP, PUT etc.) &nbsp;The /index.html launches the system. &nbsp;This loads a&nbsp;few&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;libraries with general purpose utility functions, &nbsp;/system/core/divwin.js for the Windows (divwin&nbsp;is loaded early to facilitate the log-view&nbsp;window)&nbsp;, &nbsp;system/core/webdav.js so it can detect files to load and finally system/core/init.js. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>init.js</h2>

<p>The main job of init.js is to load modules and then run the scripts in /system/init.</p>

<p>Modules are loaded from the /system/core/modules directory are loaded and eval()-ed&nbsp;with the result placed in sys.modules via <code>sys.modules[module.name]=module; </code>Each module may provide an API by this means.</p>

<p>The scripts in /system/init&nbsp;provide startup actions. &nbsp;The Desktop and Panel are installed by scripts here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Handlers</h2>

<p>&nbsp;The Handlers module in turn loads all of the handlers in /system/core/handlers/ &nbsp;Each hander&nbsp;specifies&nbsp;?mediatypes that they can perform actions upon as well as the code for performing that action. &nbsp;A few custom content&nbsp;types are specified for Notanos, &nbsp;most significantly for directories. &quot;directory&quot; is handled by the dumbdirectoryview.js handler and &quot;directory/bundle&quot; is handled by bundlehandler.js. &nbsp; A directory bundle is identified by the presence of a bundle.json inside a directory.</p>

<p>for example.<span >&nbsp; &nbsp;<code>sys.modules.handlers.performAction(&quot;Open&quot;,&quot;/apps/</code></span><code>glgears</code><span ><code>&quot;)</code> will identify /apps/</span>glgears<span > as a directory containing a bundle.json so open it with the bundle handler which inspects the </span>json<span > which contains an exec object specifying that it should now call </span><span ><code>sys.modules.handlers.performAction(&quot;Open&quot;,&quot;/apps/</code></span><code style="line-height: 1.6em;">glgears<span >/index.html&quot;,{&quot;</span>windowWidth<span >&quot;:256,&quot;</span>windowHeight<span >&quot;:256},&quot;application/</span>webapp</code><span ><code>&quot;)</code></span></p>

<p><span >This tells </span>performAction<span > to treat /apps/</span><span >glgears</span><span >/index.html as the content type&nbsp;application/</span><span >webapp instead of html. &nbsp;The webapp handler is the handler that launches the index.html in a frame inside a new divwindow.</span></p>

<h2>The Message API</h2>

<p>This is the intended mechanism for client frames to request services from the host environment. &nbsp;There are just a few calls available at present. &nbsp;loadFile, saveFile and openFileDialog. &nbsp;Obviously more are required and will be added as I need to use them. &nbsp;At present, due to the unrestricted access&nbsp;the system allows, client frames could in-principle bypass the message API entirely, but once a security layer is added, applications in frames will not be allowed to access the server side directly.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>The CSS descibing the user interface is a single monolithic css file /system/core/ui.css.  This should be changed to something more modular,  Possibly constructing a single css from multiple SASS or LESS files. </p>
<p>Notanos makes extensive use of data attributes to allow CSS presentation of content.
<pre><code>
ul.fileview > li[data-contenttype='application/javascript']>.image {
  background-image: url('/system/data/icons/default/mimetypes/application-javascript.svg');
}
</code></pre>
A fileview can be changed from icon view to details view simply by changing an attibute<br>
<code>&lt;ul class="fileview icons&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>  procudes an icon view<br>
<code>&lt;ul class="fileview details&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code> changes the view to details mode<br>
</p>

<p>More control for theming will become available when the CSS3 attr() function becomes widely usable on any attribute.
At the time of writing,  All of the browsers that support attr() restrict it to content attributes</p>

<h2>General Untidiness</h2>
<p>This project grew out of a variety of experiments.  At one stage the entire system could run out of LocalStorage.
There are a large number of incomplete parts, and remnants of wrong turns.   The divwin JavaScript started life as something to display 
simple pop-up info, then it grew somewhat.  The css class for the window is still miniwin as a reminder of its humble beginnings.</p>

<p>Many parts could benefit from being rewritten,  As with all programming projects I know a great deal more about
what I am attempting than I did when I started.  Some may be horrified at the state of some of the internals, I apologise
in advance for offending your sensibilities.</p>
<p>One aspect in-particular needs addressing,  There are a number of blocking http requests that should be converted to callbacks.
At this stage of development is is much easy to write <code>x=read(j);for (i in x) {z=read(i); doSomethingWith(z)}</code> than to write a callback equivalent.
With the server component on the local network, this is usable, but not ideal.  I have been looking at the various libraries for converting sync to async
but have yet to see one that is obviously the 'right' choice.</p> 
<p>I add bits where I need to to be able to do things in the environment myself.  I am at the point where I can edit and save
the code for Notanos from within the Notanos I carry around on my tablet,  As I want to do more stuff I'll be supporting more things.</p>
