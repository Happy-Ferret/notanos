<h2>What happen?</h2>

<p><i>Notanos has had a substantial reconfigure,  If you are interested in seeing what I said about it ages ago you can look at <a href="readme_old.html">the old Readme</a></i> </p>
<p><i>A lot of the plans from that readme have now been implemented.  The server is no-longer WebDav. You login with your unix username and password.   Data travels via https(using SOCAT to forward to a local port). Processes on the host machine can open up windows on the browser machine.  </i></p>


<p>Notanos is a desktop environment of sorts, using HTML+CSS+JavaScript.  It can be used to provide a desktop interface to a Linux device that has a network connection.
I have run Notanos on A x86 desktop, a Arm based CubieBoard, and on a 7 inch tablet (running Debian underneath Android).</p>
<P>Of particular interest to me is the possibility of providing an interface to devices like the Rasberry-Pi, and portable devices such as phones and Tablets enabling
A portable, yet cloudless work environment</p>

<p>Eveything is still in a very early stage of development, but has progressed to being actually usable. Some Notanos development does occur from within Notanos itself now.</p>

<center><img src="userserv.png"><p>This is the new architecture for notanos</center>

<p>The userserv process is specifically designed to be small and simple.  The listening process needs to run as Root to allow user logins.  The actual serving of static files and process launching are only done after dropping privelages to that of the authenticated user.  This allows the user access to things they would normally be allowed to access with a regular shell login</p>

<p>Any statically served web page could be converted to an app for Notanos.  A web application window is simply an iframe.  Additional functionality is provided by sending messages to the frame's parent window.
The API available to such programs is rather rudimentary at this stage but is being filled out when particular funtionality is required.</p>

<p> A clientframe.js file exists to manage the message interface and translate function calls into messages,  As of now only a few functions are provided
<ul>
    <li>function loadFile (filename,callback)</li>
    <li>function saveFile(filename,content,callback)</li>
    <li>function openFileDialog(initialFilename,callback) </li>
    <li>function saveFileDialog(initialFilename,callback)</li>
    <li>function setWindowTitle(text,callback)</li>
    <li>function exit()</li>
</ul>
    All functions are asynchronous and receive their results via callbacks of the form function(err,result) 
</p>
<p>Adding support for more functions is easy.  Determining the right functions to add, less so. </p>
