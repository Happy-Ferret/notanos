Notanos:  It's not an OS.

Currently supporting i386 and Arm.

The first three steps just provide a dependancy then set up a user in which we do the real work.
This should ease concerns about running strange foreign programs on your system.
(should you lack easy_install you will need to install that first.  (  "sudo apt-get install python-setuptools"  on Ubuntu)) 

         sudo easy_install -U wsgidav
         sudo adduser somenewuser
         sudo login somenewuser

You should be logged in as a new user to download the support binaries.

If you are running on arm use.

         wget http://fingswotidun.com/cruft/nossupportbin-arm.tar.gz
         tar -xzf nossupportbin-arm.tar.gz

if you are running on i386 use 

         wget http://fingswotidun.com/cruft/nossupportbin-i386.tar.gz
         tar -xzf nossupportbin-i386.tar.gz

next grab notanos itself

	wget http://fingswotidun.com/cruft/notanos.tar.gz
	tar -xzf notanos.tar.gz 
	sh startnosserver.sh 


The server should now be running.  
From a browser open navigate to the machine at port 8009
for the same machine as the server just use localhost

http://localhost:8009/index.html
